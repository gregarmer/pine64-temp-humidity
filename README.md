# Pine 64 - Temperature / Humidity Reader

This code reads the temperature and relative humidity from a Pine64 I2C PMSD001 sensor.

It's wired up via the Pi 2 bus as follows:

- Pin 3 - SDA
- Pin 4 - DC 5V
- Pin 5 - SCL
- Pin 6 - GND

Note that this I2C sensor can function also 3.3V, however, it is dangerous to use that pin on the GPIO as a pull up to 5V on a 3.3V pin can destroy the entire board. Use well-insulated connectors when connecting I2C this way.

## Building

    sudo apt-get -y install golang
    echo 'export GOPATH=$HOME/go' >> ~/.bashrc
    . ~/.bashrc
    go get golang.org/x/exp/io/i2c
    go build pmsd001.go

## Usage

    sudo ./pmsd001

returns e.g. `1612530062      21.21   70.11   48.11` where the tab-separated values are:
1. timestamp in UTC
2. temperature in °C
3. temperature in °F
4. relative humidity in %

Note that one decimal is significant for applications, however, using two decimals results in smoother data.

## Plotting

When concatenating measurements to `pmsd001.log`, a PNG graph can be plotted with

    gnuplot pmsd001.plt
